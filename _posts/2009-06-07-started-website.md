I just started this website, and I will continue to work on it until it is finished.

<!-- excerpt -->

This website was primarily made because when I uploaded my first application to Apple (iInterrupt), it asked for a website. Now that I have made it, I will keep it and update it often. With technology and all, changing rapidly, I will be posting updates as soon as I find them, to inform others of my knowledge.

For now, be prepared to view changes around this site. I will post an update when finished.
