So as you all may, or may not know, I have recently been working on my first iPhone game.

That's right, a game. Some of you may not know that games are *much* different from regular applications, in the programming aspect. I spent a lot of time researching different techniques for developing iPhone games, and the best one I found was Cocos2d, a free and open source game engine for the iPhone SDK.

Cocos2d is available for download [here](//cocos2d-swift.org/) (for free).

It comes with TONS of example applications, for reference, and knowledge. This application has a slightly different syntax from the standard iPhone SDK Objective-C, but it is very easy to understand and get used to.

One of the other great things about Cocos2d, is that it is easily compatible with Chipmunk, and Box2D. Although I personally haven't messed around with Box2D yet, I know that Chipmunk is a fantastic physics engine. Chipmunk was easily capable of being integrated into the game I was making, and it helped me out greatly. Chipmunk is also open source, and C based. With Chipmunk, you can create gravity, a character, separating the limbs, and giving them their own mass.

I really recommend that anybody looking for a great game engine, to check out Cocos2d for iPhone, and Chipmunk.
