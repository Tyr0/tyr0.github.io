This Thursday I presented my progress on my Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo helmet, had a blast. For those of you who haven't heard of Guy-Manuel, perhaps you've heard of Daft Punk? If not, then hopefully you'll still find this post interesting.

<!-- excerpt -->

I purchased the base of the helmet in late 2011, but never actually got around to working on it. Finally, back in December, I found some motiviation to begin working on it. Here's the presentation I did at the monthly [LA Arduino Enthusiasts](//www.meetup.com/LA-Arduino/) meetup, for those of you in the area that haven't been, I highly encourage checking it out.

This is an active project, and I will be fully open sourcing my work. Expect my code, schematics, and circuit board designs to be on my GitHub [here](//github.com/Tyr0/Guy-Manuel-Helmet).
