Growing up in my time, from the early 90’s to now, I have always had a computer by my side. Computers have just been there for me, since the beginning, and I have never questioned their existence. Until now.

iWoz is the autobiography of Steve Wozniak, the creator of what we now call the computer. The book starts off from when Steve was a little kid, and continues through to modern day (or 2006). It goes through Steve’s childhood, and how amazingly gifted he was with electronics. With his father by his side throughout his life, Steve saw through the panels of flashing lights, and punch cards we used to call computers. iWoz is the true story of how Steve Wozniak went from computer geek, to cult icon. It explains how he invented the personal computer, co-founded Apple, and had fun doing it.

Now usually I don’t like to read, but this was an exception. This book was simply amazing. It filled the gap I had, with every tiny little detail. I really recommend this book for all. It is a great read for young, to learn about the past, and for old, to fill in the missing details.

Now, I don’t want to spoil the book for anyone, so [here’s a link](//www.amazon.com/iWoz-Computer-Invented-Personal-Co-Founded/dp/0393330435) to get this FANTASTIC book, I truly recommend it.
