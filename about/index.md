## About

Hi! I write code for [Apple](//www.apple.com/). I like to break things with Objective-C and Ruby. I was born and raised in Cali.

I've worked on various projects in multiple languages, ranging from iOS & Android to full stack web development using Ruby on Rails.

## Work

I've worked on multiple side projects, for both fun and knowledge. I have experience ranging from HTML, JavaScript, Ruby (and Rails) to compilable code like Objective-C and Java. I enjoy learning new languages and bettering my techniques in the languages I already know.
